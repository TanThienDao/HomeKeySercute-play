Only users with an authorized key can enter the house. To enter the 
house, the user must first put their key in the lock,
 then turn the lock, then enter the house, only if the key is valid.
A house can be rekeyed with new keys only by the owner,
 and only if the owner is inside the house.

Firefighters can enter with the secret key (literal string) FIREFIGHTER_SECRET_KEY.

The lock will always be accessed in the following way: insert key, 
turn the lock, then enter the house 
(it is not guaranteed that it is the same user, however). 
Other commands can be issued in between insert, turn, and enter, 
however they do not affect the lock state.

Testing if a key is valid is done when the lock is turned.
